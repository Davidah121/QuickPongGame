# QuickPongGame
A simple version of Pong created in C++ using the Windows API for rendering.

<h1>Premise</h1>
<p>I wanted to use everything that I learned in C++ and the Windows API to create something.</p>
<p>I decided to create version of Pong while writing most things from scratch.</p>
<p>I also decided to see how long it would take to do this.</p>
<p>This was done over a span of 2 days taking about 7-8 hrs in total if I remember correctly.</p>

<h1>Why?</h1>
<p>I mostly wanted to challenge myself to develop something that was gaming related and do so in C++</p>
<p>This was also because during this time, I found that creating games using Unity required more work and time than I was willing due to a larger knowledge wall than I was prepared for.</p>
<p>I also kept in mind that being able to produce products fast but with good quality is a necessary skill so this project
  helped build that skill somewhat.</p>
<p>Pong was chosen since the game's mechanics are quite simple and the shapes used are also simple. This allows for very simple drawing methods and simple collision methods.</p>

<h1>What is next</h1>
<p>I would very much like to do another project like this again as it was fun.</p>
<p>I would like to try tetris next in the near future.</p>
